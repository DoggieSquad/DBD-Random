# DBD-Randomizer
A Dead By Daylight randomizer for the role of killer and survivor

Currently on DBD version 9.1.0

This is a small somewhat messy project of mine written in C that runs in terminal.
I wanted to create a text-based randomizer that was both small in size, fast, updated quickly, and be shared around easily with others who are fans of Dead By Daylight.
Please excuse the messy source code as I'm still learning C and hope to improve on it.
If you want to take a shot at making improvements, feel free to!

For any bugs or mispellings, please comment or message me on Discord at DoggieSquad.
